After using the Dacade tutorial provided, I came up with CelCast a podcast streaming platform for the blockchain where anyone can upload their audio experience. I also added a fan support feature where users can help their favorite podcast by supporting with 2cUSD. This helps the podcaster gain financial incentive to continue broadcasting. In the future, I plan to integrate the audio with IPFS so as to make the audio file distributed. One extra feature I added was to make sure that users cant donate to themselves. You are free to review and make additions and optimizations
